"Hiawatha's Childhood is an inspired little work and the best
thus far composed for education purposes. In fact if is worthy of
presentation as a curtain raiser in the leading Opera Houses. It is a
fine piece of musical art, and entirely practicable for schools (Grammar
and High Schools). The children love it, and the work, whether
given with or without action, makes a delightful impression."

<h2>The Laurel Octavo Edition of Martha</h2>

<p>is the outcome of extended and careful work, having for its aim
the presentation of a version of this opera which shall be adapted
primarily for use in schools.</p>

<p>It is suitable for performance in concert form as well as on the
stage with scenery and in costume.</p>

<p>Everything of value in the musical score has been retained in
the present edition. All dull and uninteresting numbers and tedious
unnecessary repetitions have been left out, while the valuable
music of the opera has been retained and the same has been
brought together into a harmonious whole.</p>

<p>The text has been revised and, where necessary, rewritten, and
is superior to the editions now current both in literary excellence
and in the valuable desideratum of "accents" and other adaptabilities
to musical utterance.</p>

<p>The Laurel Octavo Libretto of MARTHA supplies the dialogue,
stage directions and everything in which the copy for concert
purposes is lacking to make the Opera suitable for stage
representation.</p>

<p>Costumes may be obtained through the publishers.</p>

<p>Orchestration of this edition may be obtained from the publishers.</p>

could not have tended you more anxiously. You were a
mere baby when your father died and left you in our care.
No one could help trying to make up your loss to you, somehow.
If I'd a mind I might have been jealous of you. I was<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>

owed them to me, for I was her own naughty boy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Martha, I will never again ask any toil of you, or any

that seemed to me so pretty and so sweet! Are all girls as
lovely as you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady H.</span> Don't you know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> I never noticed a girl before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady H.</span> (<i>archly</i>). Where have your eyes been?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady H.</span> Alas! and I feel as if I have already learned how shallow

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Poor little maid! You have had too hard a life. Such
service has burdened you with care too soon. Here you will
never again have to labor beyond your strength. I would
myself do all disagreeable tasks rather than require them of
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady H.</span> Oh, I am a good-for-nothing. I never did a real day's
work in all my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> You must not scold yourself. Martha is my servant now,
and I would not exchange her for a dozen others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady H.</span> But can you not see that I am not worth my salt? I
shall only be an expense to you. I cannot earn a shilling a
week. See my hands. (<i>Shows them.</i>) Do they look like
useful members?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> (<i>takes them in his hands</i>). So white and soft! Surely never
servant before had such pretty fingers. Not a spot of toil!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady H.</span> And so of course they are of no use to you, and you
will not keep me here any longer. You will let them go&mdash;this
useless pair of hands?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> I cannot let them go!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady H.</span> (<i>tries to withdraw her hands</i>). But if I work they will
become hard and stained. I have never been taught&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> Never worked before? Then I will teach you and share
your every task. What <i>can</i> you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady H.</span> I can sing a little.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio</span> And you can smile. (<i>He looks at her; her eyes fall.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady H.</span> Sing and smile! A working maid must do something
more than that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lio.</span> If you will stay with me here and smile and sing, you shall
see how pleasant you will find it. You shall have no rough
tasks. You shall have only kindness and happiness. You

dispense blessing and peace. (<i>Kisses them.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plun.</span> Won't marry her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nan.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plun.</span> I am not in love with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nan.</span> But you will find plenty of other handsome lasses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plun.</span> The more I search, the less I find.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[39]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nan.</span> O, indeed. How unfortunate&mdash;for the girls!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plun.</span> None of them suit me. You see, I had a maid once&mdash;a
little serving maid&mdash;the gayest, prettiest creature&mdash;but she
ran away from me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nan.</span> Perhaps you were not kind to her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plun.</span> Kind, I? I was kindness itself! I was <i>too</i> kind! I <i>killed</i>
her with kindness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nan.</span> Well, that's the trouble, then. A girl needs a good firm
upstanding sort of a way, to keep her in her place. Don't be
too easy,&mdash;take my advice. But tell me about your servant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plun.</span> O, I don't know as she was so much, after all. But I found
her amusing. She was a well-meaning sort of creature, and
rather good looking, but she couldn't do a thing! She could
not knit or spin, she could only laugh and joke.&mdash;But ignorant
as she was, she knew one thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nan.</span> What was that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plun.</span> How to make me miss her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nan.</span> Perhaps she misses you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plun.</span> (<i>starts toward her</i>). Nancy&mdash;my little Betsy Ann!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nan.</span> And though she does not know the things you say, though
she is a poor silly creature who never did a useful thing in all
her life&mdash;could she not learn?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plun.</span> Don't torment me, girl. Do you mean what you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nan.</span> (<i>laughing at him</i>). Certainly I mean it. What clever
girl could not learn those things&mdash;if she really&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plun.</span> Really&mdash;what?&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nan.</span> O, if it were worth while!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plun.</span> O Nancy, is it worth while?&mdash;But no, we must not think
of ourselves while Lionel is in such a state&mdash;my poor Lionel!
Until he is right again my home is his.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nan.</span> (<i>walking off a little stiffly</i>). O, keep your old home! Nobody
wants it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plun.</span> (<i>goes after her and speaks in her ear</i>). I mean to keep it&mdash;and
you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nan.</span> If you can!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plun.</span> I can. A voice whispers in my heart!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[40]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nan.</span> What is the voice that whispers in your heart?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plun.</span> It is the voice of love.</p>

Then you were set free without my aid&mdash;O wretched, cruel
girl that I was! Lionel, I am fairly punished for my worldly

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
